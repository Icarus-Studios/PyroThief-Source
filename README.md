Pyrothief is a slasher survival game where the player takes on the role of Prometheus battling through domains of mythical creatures and greek gods. The player has a top-down isometric view on the game, allowing for large parts of the map to be visible. They must move between areas and clear enemies to escape as the creatures increase in number and difficulty.
